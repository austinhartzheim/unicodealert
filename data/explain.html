      <h2>Any Questions?</h2>

      <div class="question">
	<h3>Why did I receive a warning?</h3>
	<p>You received this warning because you visited a website with a suspicious URL.</p>
	<p>Websites that use foreign character sets can attempt to impersonate a legitimate website by using special letters to disguise the fact that you are visiting a similar website. For example, <span class="mono">&#233;xample.com</span> looks very similar to <span class="mono">example.com</span>. One version has an accent mark over the letter "e."</p>

      <div class="question">
	<h3>Is my computer secure?</h3>
	<p>If this was a dangerous website, it is possible that malware was installed. Following the <a href="https://www.stopbadware.org/protect-your-pc">instructions</a> from the non-profit Stop Badware organization will help reduce your risk, but cannot guarantee security.</p>
	<p>If you believe you are at risk, you should have your computer examined by a professional.</p>

      <div class="question">
	<h3>How can I prevent these warnings?</h3>
	<p>Never click on links in emails or other messages that claim to be from a bank, financial institution, or government agency. Instead, attempt to navigate to the website directly or visit the office in person.</p>
